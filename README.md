# p-Laplacian_GCNs
From Simone Scala's Master Thesis in Applied Mathematics: applications in Graph Convolutional Neural Networks of the discretized differential p-Laplacian operator as a convolution filter. Numerical experiments using different values of p treating it as an hyperparameter in a grid search. On small datasets. Code not optimized.
